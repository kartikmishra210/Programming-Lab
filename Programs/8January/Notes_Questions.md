- Nested if
- Loops (for, while, do-while)

- Do-while is exit controlled loop, meanning it will execute the code block atleast once before checking the condition.
- while loop is entry controlled, meaning to execute the code block even once the condition must first be true.

# Loops

- for Loop :

  ```for(initialization;condition;updation)
	{codeblock}
  ```

  ```while(condition) {

		      }
  ```
