# C-Programming

- C is a low-level language often helpful to directly access hardware components and is very close to Assembly language.

- C is a compiled language i.e. it uses a compiler to compile the program first and then run it.

- A C program, like many other languages starts from including libraries, a standard library for example is ```stdio.h``` which is the Standard Input Output Library, the ```.h``` implies that it is a header file. A header file inclusion tells the preprocessor to copy the code in the included header and strip the "Pre-processor Directive" which is ```#include <stdio.h>``` and then passes the code onto Compiler which later compiles it.

- Note that Compiler has to process the code first before running it, this means that any changes in the code must be re-compiled before running, unlike Interpreted Languages
